I like to build websites using Ruby on Rails, then make them look good using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, Less, Sass, and more. I call Chicago my home. When I'm not building, you'll find me reading about ways I can improve my code, design trends, what's new in tech, or exploring a new coffee shop.</p>

                <p>When I wanted to find a healthy meal near me, I was tired of having to first check what's near me, then cross-reference menu items at each place comparing nutritional information. I wanted a tool where I can simply enter where I am, the maximum number of calories I want to consume that meal, and what cuisine I'm in the mood for and have it find specific items that meet my criteria.</p>

              <li data-content="challenges">
                <p>I had to pull lots of food data from various sources and input that data into my database. I also needed the Google Maps API to cross-reference restaurant names that it found within my search radius with the restaurant names I entered into my database to pull up their nutritional nutritional information.</p>
              </li>

              <li data-content="solutions">
                <p>I found a crawler called <a href="http://www.kimonolabs.com/learn/intro" target="_blank">Kimono</a> that I used to crawl nutritional data from restaurant websites. I then used the <a href="https://github.com/Empact/roo" target="_blank">Roo gem</a> to pull the data from my spreadsheet and seed the database. I was able to enter approximately 30 restaurants worth of food data and then put the project on hold, realizing that gathering all of the nutritional data for the tens of thousands of restaurants out there was no easy task.</p>
